# 🎟️ Event Ticket System - Smart Contract

## 📝 Project Description

The Event Ticket System is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It enables event organizers to create events and sell tickets directly to users in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way.

## 🎯 Project Vision

To eliminate fraudulent ticketing practices, empower event organizers, and give users full control over their purchased tickets using the trustless and decentralized nature of blockchain technology.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Event Creation**: Only the contract owner can create new events with specific details like name, location, date, and ticket price.
- **Ticket Purchase**: Users can securely purchase tickets directly through the smart contract using cryptocurrency (ETH).
- **Ownership Records**: Tickets are tied to wallet addresses ensuring proof of ownership.
- **Event Deactivation**: Admins can deactivate events to prevent further ticket purchases.
- **Funds Withdrawal**: Collected funds can be withdrawn by the event organizer securely.

## 🔭 Future Scope

- ✅ Integration with Front-End (React, Web3.js)
- ✅ NFT Ticketing System for improved ownership tracking and secondary sales
- ✅ QR Code generation for ticket verification
- ✅ Marketplace for resale of event tickets
- ✅ Role-based Access for multiple organizers
- ✅ Discount Coupons and Whitelist Presales
